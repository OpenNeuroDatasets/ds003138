This longitudinal intervention study investigated the influence of a 2-3 weeks slackfline training on white-matter plasticity. 60 subjects were randomly assigned to either the slackline-intervention (SIG) group or to a control group (CG). For each participant we acquired MR-data of 3 time points including a high-resolution T1 and a multi shell diffusion dataset (including reverse phase encoding direction). For the SIG the measurement took place for the training (TP1) directly after the 2-3 weeks intervention (TP2) and the 3 weeks afterwards (TP3). Participants in the CG were investigated following the same time table. 
Possible postural transfer-effects were recording with 2 different tests (Challange-board and Y-test). Performance data can be found in the phenotype directory.
